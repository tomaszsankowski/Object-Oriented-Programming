# Object-Oriented-Programming
Simple ecosystem simulator using object-oriented programming paradigmates made in 3 different languages: C++, Java and Python.

The same project (with small extensions in Java and Python - especially game is not played in console, but in normal window) is a simple game, where we are using arrow keys to move our player (human). Plants are able to grow in random direction with specified probability. Every animal have its own strength points and is moving in specified way, for example wolves are always moving towards nearest sheep. The game does not have any goal - it is just kind of simulation of an environment. Projects were made during my object-oriented programming course and are supposed to teach me all four of OOP paradigms.
